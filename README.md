# ricky-bot
## This is a Discord Server Joke bot I made with Javascript and JSON. This bot is pretty basic at this point, and is created mostly as a joke. The current set of commands can be found in the commands.json or below. These commands are defualted to use the "!" key. (ex. !server)
### "Command":"Description"
   #### "tpb":"Sends a random quote form .",
   #### "ricky-help":"Get help on any of the commands this bot has.",
   #### "ricky-info":"Sends some bot info."
